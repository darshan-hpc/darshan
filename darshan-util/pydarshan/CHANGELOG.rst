PyDarshan-3.4.7.0
=================
* Support for extracting and analyzing new DAOS instrumentation
  module data

  - summary CLI tool now integrates DAOS data into reports
* New CLI tools for extracting and printing summary data for
  one or more Darshan logs

  - `job_stats` prints high-level statistics on a per-job level
  - `file_stats` prints high-level statistics on a per-file level
  - output in either CSV format or using the Rich package (which
    is now a proper dependency of PyDarshan)
* Add DarshanReport object capability to filter module records
  according to given regular expressions

  - users can now pass the following parameters to DarshanReport
    objects to use this functionality: `filter_patterns` (a list
    of regex strings to match against) and `filter_mode` (either
    "exclude" or "include")
  - integrated this capability into summary CLI tool to allow
    filtering of data before generating reports

  - add new plot of POSIX module sequential/consecutive accesses
  - include PnetCDF `wait` time in I/O cost figures
  - drop default generation of DXT-based heatmaps and add
    a new cmdline option to force generate them (--enable_dxt_heatmap)
  - drop usage of scientific notation in "Data access by category"
    plot
  - make captions, axis labels, and annotations clearer and
    easier to read
* Integrated Python support for darshan-util accumulator API for
  aggregating file records and calculating derived metrics

  - Added backend routine `accumulate_records`, which returns
    a derived metric structure and a summary record for an
    input set of records
  - Added backend routine `_df_to_rec` to allow conversion of
    a DataFrame of records into raw byte arrays to pass into
    the darshan-util C library (e.g., for using accumulator API)
* Fixed bug allowing binary wheel installs to prefer darshan-util
  libraries found in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (reported by Jean Luca Bez)
* Fixed bug in DXT heatmap plotting code related to determining
  the job's runtime
* Updated docs for installation/usage of PyDarshan
* Dropped support for Python 3.6
