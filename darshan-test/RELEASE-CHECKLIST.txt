Notes on how to release a new version of Darshan
2021-06
-----------------------

 1) check Darshan GitHub to see if there are any pending issues and/or PRs
    for the release milestone
    (https://github.com/darshan-hpc/darshan/milestones)
 2) check for any problems in Jenkins and ALCF CI regular builds
 3) make sure that documentation in darshan-util/doc/ and darshan-runtime/doc/
    are up to date
    - commit
 4) update the Changelog, if needed (browse git log since last release)
    - commit
 5) update version number in configure.in (see AC_INIT)
    - in both darshan-util/ and darshan-runtime/
    - re-run ./prepare in both darshan-util and darshan-runtime
    - commit
 6) follow checklist for corresponding release of PyDarshan
    - found at darshan-util/pydarshan/RELEASE-CHECKLIST-PyDarshan.txt
    - NOTE: new PyDarshan version must be released with every Darshan release
 7) use "git status" to make sure that all changes have been committed and
    pushed to origin/main
 8) TESTING
    - manually trigger Jenkins and ALCF CI tests
 9) generate example output files on x86_64 and commit in
    darshan-test/example-output/ directory
10) make a tag for the release according to instructions at
    http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
    - example (annotated tag, pushed to repo):
      git tag -a darshan-2.3.1 -m 'Darshan 2.3.1'
      git push origin darshan-2.3.1
11) manually create the release tarball
    - do a fresh checkout of the Darshan release tag
      git clone --branch darshan-2.3.1 \
      https://github.com/darshan-hpc/darshan.git darshan-2.3.1
    - make sure to pull in AutoPerf submodule
      git submodule update --init
    - remove all .git files/directories in the top-level of the repo
    - create release tarball
      tar -czvf darshan-2.3.1.tar.gz /path/to/darshan-2.3.1
    - upload tarball to MCS FTP server
      scp -J user@homes.cels.anl.gov darshan-2.3.1.tar.gz \
      user@login.mcs.anl.gov:/mcs/ftp/pub/darshan/releases/
      (NOTE: must copy files through CELS servers to reach MCS)
12) generate web documentation from asciidoc by running make in
    darshan-util/doc/ and darshan-runtime/doc/ directories
    - upload .html files to MCS server (/mcs/web/research/projects/darshan/docs)
13) update download page on darshan web site: www.mcs.anl.gov/darshan/download
14) update darshan-runtime and darshan-util Spack packages with new release
    - consider whether new variants should be exposed based on new features
      enabled by the release
    - commit, submit PR to upstream Spack repository
15) announce on web page (new post) and mailing list
