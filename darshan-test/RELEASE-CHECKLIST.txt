Notes on how to release a new version of Darshan
2024-05
-----------------------

 1) check Darshan GitHub to see if there are any pending issues and/or PRs
    for the release milestone
    (https://github.com/darshan-hpc/darshan/milestones)
    - close the milestone, move unfinished issues to appropriate milestone
 2) check for any problems in recent CI workflows on the main GitHub and
    on the ALCF GitLab CI instance
 3) make sure that documentation in darshan-util/doc/ and darshan-runtime/doc/
    are up to date
    - commit
 4) update the Changelog, if needed (browse git log since last release)
    - commit
 5) update version number in top-level darshan.version file
    - commit
 6) follow checklist for corresponding release of PyDarshan
    - found at darshan-util/pydarshan/RELEASE-CHECKLIST-PyDarshan.txt
    - NOTE: new PyDarshan version must be released with every Darshan release
 7) use "git status" to make sure that all changes have been committed and
    pushed to origin/main
 8) manually install Darshan and run regression tests on a workstation and/or
    an HPC system (e.g., ALCF Polaris)
    - after installing, run the following in darshan-test/regression:
      ./run-all.sh <darshan_install_prefix> <scratch_dir> <system_env_profile>
 9) copy example output file (from the above testing) and commit in
    the darshan-logs repo in the darshan_logs/release_logs/ directory
10) make a tag for the release according to instructions at
    http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
    - example (annotated tag, pushed to repo):
      git tag -a darshan-2.3.1 -m 'Darshan 2.3.1'
      git push origin darshan-2.3.1
11) manually create the release tarball
    - do a fresh checkout of the Darshan release tag
      git clone --branch darshan-2.3.1 \
      https://github.com/darshan-hpc/darshan.git darshan-2.3.1
    - make sure to pull in AutoPerf submodule
      git submodule update --init
    - remove all .git files/directories in the top-level of the repo
    - create release tarball
      tar -czvf darshan-2.3.1.tar.gz /path/to/darshan-2.3.1
    - upload tarball to CELS server
      scp darshan-2.3.1.tar.gz user@homes.cels.anl.gov:/nfs/pub_html/gce/projects/darshan/releases/
12) generate web documentation from asciidoc by running make in
    darshan-util/doc/ and darshan-runtime/doc/ directories
    - upload .html files to CELS server (/nfs/pub_html/gce/projects/darshan/docs)
    - This step is only applicable to release of 3.4.7 and prior. Documents of
      later releases have been migrated to readthedocs.io, which are
      automatically generated every time a new commit is pushed.
13) update download page on darshan web site: www.mcs.anl.gov/darshan/download
14) update darshan-runtime and darshan-util Spack packages with new release
    - consider whether new variants should be exposed based on new features
      enabled by the release
    - commit, submit PR to upstream Spack repository
15) announce on web page (new post) and mailing list
