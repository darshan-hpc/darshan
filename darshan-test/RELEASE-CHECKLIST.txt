  - in both darshan-util/ and darshan-runtime/
  - re-run ./prepare in both darshan-util and darshan-runtime
  - commit
- generate example output files on x86_64 and commit in
  darshan-test/example-output/ directory
- use "git status" to make sure that all changes have been committed and
  pushed to origin/master
- make a tag for the release according to instructions at
  http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
